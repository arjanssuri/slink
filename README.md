# Slonnect

## Project Description

Slonnect is an intelligent networking assistant that automatically scans introduction channels in Discord and Slack, providing personalized recommendations for meaningful connections based on members' backgrounds, skills, and interests. By analyzing introductory messages, Slonnect helps users identify and reach out to potential collaborators, mentors, or professional contacts they might have otherwise missed.

## Features

- **Intelligent Channel Scanning**: Automatically reads and processes introduction channels across Discord and Slack
- **Smart Matching Algorithm**: Identifies potential connection opportunities based on:
  - Professional backgrounds
  - Skills and expertise
  - Shared interests
  - Complementary professional goals

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/slonnect.git

# Install dependencies
cd slonnect
npm install

# Set up your configuration
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your Slack and Discord API tokens
```

## Configuration

Create a `.env` file with the following configurations:

```
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token
SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=your_slack_bot_token
CHANNELS_TO_MONITOR=comma,separated,channel,ids
```

## Usage

```python
# Basic usage example
from slonnect import NetworkBot

# Initialize the bot
bot = NetworkBot(discord_token, slack_token)

# Start monitoring channels
bot.start_monitoring()

# Get connection recommendations
recommendations = bot.get_recommendations()
print(recommendations)
```

## How It Works

1. **Channel Monitoring**: The bot joins specified Discord and Slack channels
2. **Message Analysis**: Parses introduction messages using natural language processing
3. **Profile Matching**: Generates connection suggestions based on sophisticated matching algorithms
4. **Notification**: Provides personalized connection recommendations to users

## Ethical Considerations

- Respects user privacy
- Provides opt-out mechanisms
- Follows platform guidelines for bot usage

## Roadmap

- [ ] Multi-platform support
- [ ] Advanced matching algorithms
- [ ] Personalization settings
- [ ] Privacy controls
